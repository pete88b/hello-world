# About me

I like making things and solving problems, so it's fortunate that I work in IT.

I've been working on https://www.parexel.com/solutions/informatics/data-driven-monitoring/ since the project started a couple of years ago.

So far, all of my personal projects revolve around data bases but I have interests in many aspects of computing technology such as; language design and recognotion, system integration, UI design and data visualisaton.
